All contributors are expected to follow our

### Opening Issues

We use issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and questions. Please follow the instructions in the templates.

When opening an issue, include:
- Your operating system
- Database type and version
- SQLMind Studio version
- Clear steps to reproduce the issue (for example, relevant SQL statements)

### Pull Requests

We recommend opening an issue before starting work on a significant change to avoid duplicate effort and to discuss design approaches.

Pull requests may not be merged if they do not align with the project’s goals or direction, but we aim to communicate clearly and early to avoid wasted effort.
